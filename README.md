## üß± Design Overview

- **Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern using Java Servlets for controller logic.
- **Development Approach**: Built using Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- **Design Principles**:
  - Follows SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Liskov Substitution, etc.)
  - Abstract base model with common methods; each model class is responsible for a single action.
  - Emphasizes composition over inheritance and minimizes tight coupling.
